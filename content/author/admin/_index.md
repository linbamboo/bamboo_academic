Bamboo Lin is a Principal Bioinformatics Scientist at Roche, where she develops bioinformatics workflows and integrates computer science, statistics, and engineering to analyze NGS data. She enjoys working at the interface between the wet lab, product development, and business development. Bamboo received a B.S. degree in Power Mechanical Engineering and a M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering, both from National Tsing-Hua University in Taiwan. She received her Ph. D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Pennsylvania State University, with a focus on developing machine learning algorithms for medical image analysis. 

Bamboo started her career with a 5-person startup company, Vizyontech Imaging, Inc., where she advances ultrasound imaging on breast cancer detection. In 2013, Bamboo made a career transition to the bioinformatics field with a passion for applying machine learning algorithms to solve bioinformatics problems and taking part in innovating medical technologies. She has been enjoying working in this challenging but very rewarding field. Other than being a bioinformatician, Bamboo enjoys backpacking, swimming, and trail running.
